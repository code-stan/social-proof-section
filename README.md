### What I learned

I learnt that it's possible to fix in 2 images in **background-image** property and also control both their position with **background-position**;

Here is the code snippets below:

```css
.class{
  background-image: url("image1"), url("image2");
  background-position: x-axis y-axis, x-axis y-axis;
}
```

I learnt that **padding-inline** has 2 values input and also, **padding-block**? ðŸ¤” hmmm...
Yeah it does ðŸ˜…

Here is the code snippets below:

```css
.class {
  padding-inline: 12rem 7rem; /*This both indicating padding left and right respectively*/
}
```
